This is a a two-dimensional stormsurge model for Norwegian waters based
on the ROMS ocean model.

Before running python-script, run 
'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/disk1/$USER/metroms/apps/common/python/'.

The scripts expect a folder structure like this:
/disk1/<username>/metroms and
/disk1/<username>/tmproms (this will be made by the build-scripts)
