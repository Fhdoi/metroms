This is a version of Arctic-4km with coupled to the CICE ice model.

Before running python-script 'arctic-4km.py', run 
'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/disk1/$USER/metroms/apps/common/python/'.

The scripts expect a folder structure like this:
/disk1/<username>/metroms and
/disk1/<username>/tmproms (this will be made by the build-scripts)
