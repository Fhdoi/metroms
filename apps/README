HOW TO COMPILE UNDER METROMS:

Example given for Arctic 20km, coupled ROMS-CICE:
This has been tested on Intel computer, using Gfortran
and Ubuntu 12.04. C-shell must be installed for CICE compilation.

1:
Build MCT by executing './build_mct.sh' in metroms/apps-folder.

2:
Build CICE by executing './build_cice.sh 2 1'. The numbers indicate
how many processors you will use in x and y-direction in your CICE
application. These numbers are the current default in metroms.

3:
In folder metroms/apps, execute './build_roms.sh arctic-20km' 
to build roms-3.6 arctic-20km application. To compile in paralell, 
add the keyword '-j 4' after the name of your application to use 
4 cpus in the compilation process. You still need to specify which 
compiler etc you want to use inside the 'build_roms.sh'-file.
