HOW TO COMPILE UNDER METROMS:

Example given for Arctic 20km, coupled ROMS-CICE:
This has been tested on Intel computer, using Gfortran
and Ubuntu 12.04. C-shell must be installed for CICE compilation.

First, define the computer you use, (metlocal, vilje, .. (other should be implemented).
#export METROMS_MYHOST=vilje
#export METROMS_MYHOST=metlocal

Optionally, set the TMPDIR you want to use 
(default /disk1/$LOGNAME or /work/$LOGNAME at metlocal and vilje, respectively.)

Optionally, set the path to the local metroms version 
(default /disk1/$LOGNAME and $HOME, at metlocal and vilje, resp.)


1:
Build MCT by executing './build_mct.sh' in metroms/apps-folder.

2:
Build CICE by executing './build_cice.sh '. Optionally, give as arguments the numbers of processors you will use in x and y-direction in your CICE
application. 

3:
In folder metroms/apps, execute './build_roms.sh arctic-20km' 
to build roms-3.6 arctic-20km application. To compile in paralell, 
add the keyword '-j 4' after the name of your application to use 
4 cpus in the compilation process. You still need to specify which 
compiler etc you want to use inside the 'build_roms.sh'-file.
